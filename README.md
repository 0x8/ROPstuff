This is a collection of source code, python exploits, and anything I else I make, create, generate, etc. in my
exploration of ROP basesd attacks. I am adding code and am going to implement a naming scheme for source, binaries, and python exploit scripts based on a certain name. So if I name source code myCode.c then it will have corresponding binary myCode and corresponding python exploit script myCode.py

If you have pulled this repo at my own request to aid me in my studies, I thank you very much.
